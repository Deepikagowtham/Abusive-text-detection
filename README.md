Detecting whether comments are abusive or not

In recent years social media platforms have become a significant digital space for communication, information sharing and entertainment. However, alongside their benefits, these platforms are increasingly being used to victimize women through abusive language. Women are often targeted with hateful and derogatory comments that seek to demean, harass, or threaten them, reflecting societal biases and gender inequalities. This online abuse represents a specific form of cyberbullying which can have severe psychological, social, and professional impacts on women, necessitating effective measures to address the issue.

To tackle this challenge, I focus on online content moderation by detecting abusive text against women in comments. For this task, I scraped the comments from YouTube using specific queries targeting controversial and sensitive topics where gender-based abuse is prevalent as well as including explicit abuse, implicit bias, stereotypes, and coded language.

The goal of this task is to identify whether a given comment contains abusive comment or not.

I have added the model which i used, train and test dataset too.
